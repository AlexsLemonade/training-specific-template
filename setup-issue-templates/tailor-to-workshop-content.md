Revise the course website to reflect the content this workshop will be covering. 

For virtual workshops, the areas that need to be updated are:

* The first bulletpoint in `virtual-workshop/workshop-structure.md` (which becomes `workshop/workshop-structure.md`)
* The modules we link to in `virtual-workshop/workshop-materials.md` (which becomes `workshop/workshop-materials.md`)
