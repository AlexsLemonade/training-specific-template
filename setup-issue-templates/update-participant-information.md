- If you are running an **in-person workshop**, you should update content in `workshop/local-participant-information.md` to contain relevant logistics for this workshop.
  - Note that this page will not be directly displayed on the website.
    Instead, its content will automatically appear within the `workshop/workshop-logistics.md` page when the `_config.yml` field `workshop_type` is set to `"in-person"`.
    _You should therefore not update the  `workshop/workshop-logistics.md` file._

- If you are running a **remote** workshop, there is nothing to do here - you can close this issue for free!
