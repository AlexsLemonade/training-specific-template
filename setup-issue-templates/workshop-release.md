In [`AlexsLemonade/training-modules`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules), [create a new release](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/releases/new) that ties that material to this specific workshop. We use the convention `<year>-<month>` for tags and `<year> <month>` for release titles for Data Lab workshops.

Be sure to update the `_config.yml` file _in this repository_ accordingly:

- `release_tag` and `docker_tag` should point to the correct release
- `docker_repo` should, in most cases, be filled in with `training_rnaseq`
