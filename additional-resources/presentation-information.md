title: Participant Presentations
---

On the last afternoon of the workshop, you will be invited to give a short (5 minutes or less) presentation on what you learned/worked on during the week to the rest of the group.
This is meant to be a _low-pressure opportunity_ to reflect on what you've learned!
The content and format of the presentation is entirely up to you.
Here are some examples of what people have presented in the past at our workshops:

* Talked through part of an exercise notebook, highlighting where they ran into issues and how they figured it out
* Shown a visualization they made with their own data
* Walked through a set of slides that included tools they've used in the past and how they compare to what they learned during the workshop
* Identified some publicly available data sets relevant to their scientific questions and talked about next steps
