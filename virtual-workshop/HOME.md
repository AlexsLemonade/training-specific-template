## Getting Started


### Pre-workshop Prep

* Please review the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md).
* If you are new to using R, we've [assembled some resources for getting starting with R](../optional-workshop-prep/R-prep.md#pre-workshop-prep-for-r-programming) that can optionally help prepare you for the workshop.
* Please install the [required software](software-setup.md) and take a look at how we intend to use these platforms during the workshop (see below).
* Sign up for the **Cancer Data Science** Slack workspace at <http://ccdatalab.org/slack>. Please use your full name in your profile, so we can find you easily and add you to the private meeting channel.
* Once you have been given your username and temporary password, follow [these instructions](../virtual-setup/rstudio-login.md) to log in to our RStudio server and change your password.

Please take a look at our procedures to familiarize yourself with how we will be using these platforms throughout training:

* [Zoom procedures](../virtual-setup/zoom-procedures.md)
* [Slack procedures](../virtual-setup/slack-procedures.md)

## Schedule

<!-- Introduce general schedule here -->

**For more details on the schedule for each day, [click here](SCHEDULE.md).**

## Workshop Structure

A description of our plans and goals for the workshop can be found on the [Workshop Structure document](workshop-structure.md). Please also refer to the [schedule](SCHEDULE.md) for information about timing and links relevant to each day.
An overview of the modules we will cover and associated links can be found on the [Workshop Materials document](workshop-materials.md).

During instruction sessions, CCDL staff will lead you through course material using [Zoom](../virtual-setup/zoom-procedures.md), [Slack](../virtual-setup/slack-procedures.md), and [RStudio Server](../virtual-setup/rstudio-login.md).
We will record instruction and provide it to workshop attendees so they can revisit it outside of workshop hours or in case they experience disruptions during live instruction.

During [consultation sessions](resources-for-consultation-sessions.md), CCDL staff will be available to answer questions and provide 1:1 assistance as you work through exercise notebooks we provide or work with your own transcriptomic data.
Weâ€™ll use Zoom and Slack for these days, too.

We recommend you follow these [guidelines for posting errors](posting-errors-guidelines.md) so you can maximize others' abilities to help you resolve your error.
